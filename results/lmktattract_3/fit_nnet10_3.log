Neural Network 

167 samples
  2 predictor
  2 classes: '0', '1' 

No pre-processing
Resampling: Bootstrapped (25 reps) 
Summary of sample sizes: 167, 167, 167, 167, 167, 167, ... 
Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  size  Accuracy   Kappa    
  1     0.8561052  0.7080042
  2     0.8541117  0.7038745
  3     0.8535696  0.7029959
  4     0.8549490  0.7059662
  5     0.8542593  0.7044507

Tuning parameter 'decay' was held constant at a value of 0.3
Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
The final values used for the model were size = 1 and decay = 0.3.
